      question: "How fast can we implement?",
      answer: "Typical multi‑hospital pilots are live in weeks, scaling to districts/states thereafter. Our proven implementation playbook ensures rapid deployment with minimal disruption to existing workflows."
    },
    {
      question: "What about data ownership and licensing?",
      answer: "MIT license; governments own code and data; no vendor lock‑in. You have complete control over your infrastructure and data sovereignty with zero ongoing licensing costs."
    },
    {
      question: "Can we localize forms and terminologies?",
      answer: "Yes—custom EMR forms map to FHIR; BYOT (Bring Your Own Terminology) supported. You can configure local terminologies, forms, and workflows while maintaining FHIR compliance."
    },
    {
      question: "Does CARE support national programs like ABDM?",
      answer: "Yes—ABDM M1–M3 via plugin; deployed across 6 states. CARE integrates seamlessly with national health programs and standards."
    },
    {
      question: "Can we add remote monitoring and AI tools?",
      answer: "Yes—TeleICU (ONVIF), Care Scribe (AI voice fill) are available as Care Apps. AI tools integrate as plugins without modifying the core platform."
    },
    {
      question: "What about security and compliance?",
      answer: "CARE implements FHIR R5 compliance with RBAC, audit trails, and sovereign hosting options. Built-in security measures ensure data protection and regulatory compliance."
    },
    {
      question: "How does CARE handle different healthcare settings?",
      answer: "CARE adapts to various settings—hospitals, clinics, palliative care, veterinary practice. The modular architecture allows customization for different healthcare workflows."
    },
    {
      question: "What support is available for implementation?",
      answer: "We provide implementation guides, training materials, and community support. The global developer corps offers technical assistance and best practices sharing."
